                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p class="hero">My name is Robin Surell, I recently finished upper secondary school and I am currently working in the warehouse at Lekolar in Osby. When I am not at work I spend most of my time writing, reading or doing something at the computer.
                     I am a self taught “programmer” I can build websites as I am well experienced in the languages CSS and HTML. I know basic JavaScript and Git but for my needs it is enough.
                      If I had more free time I would spend it learning JavaScript. I like tech, a good story and I love interacting with other people. 
                      For me, the ideal would be combining all of these things in my work life. 
                      I built and hosted this website with my basic programming skills.

It Freedom under responibility, once we were done with the our countertops i had the oppertunity to chose my work assignments which lead to me getting to learn many of the different jobs at the comapny.
